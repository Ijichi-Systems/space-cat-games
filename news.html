   <h2>Space Cat Games now belongs to Starry Systems!</h2>
   <p>Well, we saw it coming. With the collapse of Team Astrocat, and when Astral Software Systems being a placeholder foundation to keep it running. This will hopefully mean more updates, patches and bug fixes. Stay tuned!</p>
   <br>
  <h2>Version 12 released!</h2>
  <p>Version 12 has been released to the general public. The changes in this version include the removal of things like the RSS Feed, Status page and Blooket cheats. This is because they were seen as pointless, and took the game parts of the game website away. This version also includes the final UI bar, and the gradient has made a return! </p>
  <br>
  <h2>We are so back!</h2>
  <p>I have been re-writing the whole of Space Cat Games, and so, we are moving away from GitHub and to GitLab. I will be deploying a test release on a test domain. Stay Tuned!</p>
  <br>
  <h2>Spacecatsplay.uk blocked, everybody upset!</h2>
  <p>hi guys, message from Ben the head developer - "Right, I know who did it. We will be working on getting this fixed, and I will also incorp RHProxy to the website. We are also working on other projects, so yeah. Oh and we are switching backends from Replit to someone else (Talking to Kaz about that one) Stay fresh!"</p>
  <br></br>
  <h2>Stats for 50 days uptime</h2>
