<br>
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/HDbQ8pR4/download-4.png">

<br>
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/cXsLCLkf/download-8.png">

<br>
  <img src="https://i.ibb.co/LXKCrHQp/3dgifmaker33064.gif">
  <p>This GIF was used for a very short time, logged as about 2 days. It was used for testing reponsiveness over HSTS. It was added in Version 12.3.4, and removed in Version 12.2.6. It was never shown on the site, and only used internally for testing.</p>
  <br>

<br>
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/nNHtpM9J/download-2.png">
<p>Above: this image was a prototype of the first Space Cat Games logo. It was only used in testing, and never made it to release. </p>
<br>
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/gZ11vVZj/download-1.png">
<p>Above: Version 8's logo. This was used until Version 8.5.9, when Version 9's logo was used, yet it <em>techically</em> was Version 8, internally.</p>
<br>
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/B53qsCg5/download.png">
<p>Version 7's final logo. this was the first version of Space Cat Games. The final release of Floppa Games was version 6.3.7, when the whole site was re-written, and re-named to Space Cat Games.</p>
<br>
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/JjY5b6X0/download.gif">
<p>Cut Floppa Games Version 7 logo. This was the final ever logo to be produced with the name of Floppa Games. Floppa Games Version 7, was supposed to be Codenamed "Fusion", but it was never finalized, as the name was changed to Space Cat Games. The original version of Floppa Games Version 7 has been lost, as the repositories were lost.</p>
<br>
  <h2>Other things</h2>
  <p>There is an abandoned re-write of Space Cat Games called Space Cat Games Version II. It was maintained for a short period of 2 months, and was released once. It never went mainstream, and never replaced Space Cat Games Version 11 (latest at the time). There is also a lost version of Space Cat Games Version 11, that was known internally as "SPC Legacy". It was to be released when Space Cat Games II went mainstream. It was never released, however, functions relating to SPC Legacy are still present, for example, "func.checklegacywarn()" are still used for checking what version the server is running, and to warn if running an outdated version. Originally, "func.checklegacywarn()" was going to be used to check if the version was the legacy version. If it was true, it would warn the user that the legacy version is not maintained. Now it has been demoted to a version checker. Poor guy. </p>
